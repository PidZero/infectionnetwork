Simple Infection Dynamics on Networks
=====================================

Using SIR infection dynamics on Network Models
----------------------------------------------

This project is supposed to create a class to simulate infection dynamics on several different Graph models. These include
* Random Networks
* Undirected Price Model / Barabasi - Albert Model
* Undirected Price Model with Poisson distributed neighbourhood
* Watts - Strogatz model

The dynamics are basic SIR dynamics. Basic graph properties can be calculated as well.
